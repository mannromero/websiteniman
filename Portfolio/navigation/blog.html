                MOBILE LEGENDS BANG BANG | ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOBILE GAMES
            </p>

                    I have managed to play a lot of Online Games, and now one of my favorite is Mobile Legends Bang Bang, 
                    it is gives me happiness when I able to get the Victory and Little Disappointment if got Defeated. 
                    I can say that game graphics are great, as well as the sound and gameplay options. Mobile Legends is  
                    also free to play mobile game, where you get rewards daily. Every time you log in, there is a reward  
                    and on every three hours there is a free chest. Lately, the developers made a few updates, that 
                    brought new heroes in the game.<br> <br>


                    The Mobile Legends can be further divided into six classes – Tank, Fighter, Assassin, Mage, Marksman,  
                    and Support. Tanks are shields with high health points (HP) and high defense. Fighters are team brawlers  
                    with the perfect balance between defense, damage, and HP. Each class is unique, and plays a different role  
                    on the team. <br> <br> 


                   Tanks are the shield of the team.These heroes have high health points (HP) and high defense.With their toughness, 
                   tanks break up enemy teams and help absorb damage.If you enjoy being at the front, soaking up tons of damage,  
                   then the tank role is made for you. Examples of tank heroes are Tigreal, Johnson and Grock.<br> <br> 


                  Fighters are the brawlers of the team. These heroes have a good balance between HP, defense and damage.  
                  Their balanced stats allow these heroes to get in and get out of fights alive. 
                  If you love to be in the thick of the action while killing heroes, being a fighter is the role for you. 
                  Examples of fighter heroes are Chou, Sun and Ruby. <br><br>
 
                  Assassins are the ninjas of the team. They have low HP but high damage, roaming the map, ambushing enemies 
                  in lane. If you like being sneaky and taking down enemies, the assassin role is made for you. Examples of 
                  assassin heroes are Fanny, Helcurt and Hayabusa.<br><br> 
 
Mages are long-range damage dealers with strong abilities. These heroes have high mana and low defense, relying 
on their powerful spells to chip away at the enemy’s HP and control team fights. If you enjoy spamming spells 
to annoy your opponent, picking a mage hero would suit you best. Examples of Mage heroes are Alice, Eudora <br> <br>
and Harith.<br> 
 
Marksmen are the hero killers of the team. These heroes have high damage but low defense and mobility. Marksmen 
help eliminate enemy heroes during team fights. If you love dealing damage and killing heroes, being a marksman 
is the way to go. Examples of Marksman heroes are Miya, Layla and Lesley <br> <br>
 
Supports are the backbone of the team. They have high mana and low defense like mages. However, their spells 
keep their teammates alive. If you prefer being in the back lines and keeping your team alive, then being a 
support is best for you. Examples of support heores are Angela, Diggie and Rafaela<br> <br>

         <p class="paraone pos">
My most favorite class in Mobile Legends is Assassin it is agile champion that specializes in killing or 
disabling roaming targets picking them of as they try to replenish HP. Focused on infiltration, deception, 
and mobility, assassins are opportunistic hunters who find favorable moments within a fight before jumping 
into the fray.<br> <br> 

In the assassin heros Gusion is my most favorite to use because he is very strong and deadly hero in the  
early game. This has its own weaknesses, but make sure you don’t play until late game, and finish the game  
quickly. The reason is, Gusion is only strong in the early game, and tends to be weak during the late game. 
You can also bought your favorite skin Using Codashop, topping up is made easy, safe and convenient. We are

In order to win a Mobile Legends game, you need to destroy the Enemy Base Inhibitor. Before you can start  
damaging it, you must destroy the preceding turrets in each lane. I really hate being defeated that is  
why I am doing my best to win the game, but sometimes most of my teammates is not cooperating well that’s  
why we always got defeated. Having fun is the reason why I played Mobile Legend, so Either win or lose the 
most important thing is to be happy, enjoy the game, be positive thinking and acceptance when got defeated.<br>
